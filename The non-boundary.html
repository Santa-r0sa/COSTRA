    <h1> THE NON-BOUNDARY Justin E. H. Smith </h1>

<body>
<p>A thought experiment: what would our metaphysics look like if nature or the creator had endowed us with exoskeletons? No permeable membrane would mediate between ourselves and the world. We would be not so much embodied as encased. Nutrition and respiration would go on, inside the casing, and sensation would go on too, in some unimaginable way, mostly through the quasi-olfactive chemoreceptors of our antennae. But we would lack the direct and constant experience of exposure to the world. We would lack the experience of bodily flux, of being-as Björk said of girls but may in fact be said, at the very least, of all the land-dwelling vertebrates- -fountains of blood. </p>

<p>One suspects that under such circumstances the dualism of inner and outer would only be that much stronger: inside is the self, outside is the world, and between the two is an insensate and non-negotiable wall. We would likely be only the more prone to developing philosophical theories in which the body, as Pythagoras taught, is a prison. If our outer surface, a fixed, stable, unfeeling pod, did not constitute that part of the veil of perception through which we feel out the
outer world by means of touch, would that outer world, beyond our thick panzers, seem more real, or less? Would it still be, as the philosophers say, a "problem"? </p> 

<p> Aristotle says of crayfish, crabs, turtles, and oysters that their "fleshy part" is on the inside. For them, the shell functions as a sort of lantern cover. "Since these creatures are bloodless, they possess but little heat," so the shell "encloses the faintly burning heat and protects it." The bloodless animals, as Aristotle understands them, are not entirely without fluid analogous to blood, as one can observe in the blue-green trace of liquid oozing out of a crawfish or even a squirt of hemolymph from a crushed insect. But there is no question of the liquid jetting out here, and, if the tradition placed animals life and soul-which for the Aristotelians are coextensive—in what we normally call blood, no one would have ever thought to locate an oyster's soul in its analogous fluid. Rather, it was thought to reside in its shell-enclosed fleshy part, which Aristotle calls sarx (whence our word sarcophagus, the "flesh eater"), but which may also be denoted by kreas, from which we have the word pancreas: that which is all meat, all the way through. Flesh or meat, we are starting to see, is not the same thing as skin. Flesh is the soft, moist, meat-like stuff of life, common to all animals, but which in the case of some creatures, such as oysters, can be made visible by prying them open without necessarily violating the integrity of their organic function, as you must do to cut through to the viscera of a skin-bound animal. This is possible with oysters and other shell-bound creatures insofar as they are contained within an insensate structure that is of a fundamentally different character than their flesh. </p>

<p> Skin is the sensate envelope that holds the liquid stuff of life in, if only barely, in animals coursing with blood. This is most evident in some species that are not covered with feathers or fur, notably homo sapiens, in whom one can often discern veins right beneath the taut surface and observe the phenomenon called blushing, where the blood rushes to the hairless cheeks and announces not only that the creature is alive but that there is much going on inside it. The visibility of the skin in some other animals, notably the "thick-skinned" animals previously categorized as Pachydermata, seems not to clarify the matter but to complicate it, for what does our thin membrane have in common with their thick, living leather?</p>

<p> Aristotle is concerned principally with the sensory function of skin, and pays little attention to its essential permeability. This is in part because sweat pores would not be discovered for a long time yet. A few centuries later, the physician and anatomist Galen would speculate on their existence, as how else could the sweat get through unless by some opening? Matter does not pass through matter, unless given space to do so. In 1658, the French materialist philosopher Pierre Gassendi would speak of the pores as an example of that which is "hidden by nature," and of sweat as their natural sign, "since pores are not visible, but neverthe- less sweat is of such a sort that unless there were pores through which it is able to pass over from the inside to the outside, it would not appear on the skin."? As late as 1779, William Cruikshank's speculations on pores through which perspiration might pass treated them as though they were a sort of elusive dermatological neutrino. They likely "serve not only to transmit hairs," he speculates, "but in my opinion, the greatest part of the perspirable matter itself." He conjectures even more boldly that the traffic is bidirectional: the skin is also a site of absorption, a process that, "in all prob- ability, begins on the sides of these pores." </p>

<p> Late in his career, Jacques Derrida wrote On Touching-Jean-Luc Nancy, an intimate tribute to his friend and fellow philosopher that is also, at a deeper level, a critical engagement with Aristotle's account of the sense of touch. It is one of those works of postwar French philosophy that is so absorbed in the intimacies of the author and his social circle that in reading it one easily comes to feel one is interrupting something. "Truth is in the skin," Nancy had written in his earlier work Corpus, to which Derrida was largely responding. "Now, what is skin," Derrida reflects in turn, "the pellicular, peau, peel, pelt, fell, or hide?" He congratulates his friend for having coined the neologism ex-peausition, which he affirms is a "great and necessary word."* But Nancy and Derrida both miss the skingular point in their epidermexegesis that the skin is not only stretched over nerves, but also is punctured by pores. It is not only a sensitive barrier, entering into contiguity with the outer world and with other skins, and thus into physical and physiological touch. It is also our constant reminder that we have no true barrier between us and the world, that the inner and the outer are not cleanly divided. Derrida describes the mouth as an exceptional feature of the body, a "cavity, gaping place, chasm, abyss, opening … hole, orifice." But it is not so exceptional, for the body is riddled with countless invisible mouths. Like the Vedic ogress Dirgha-jihva who had vaginas on every part of her body, a true rival to her many-penised lover, we, too, are everywhere openings.8 </p>

<p> Both Derrida and Aristotle in part overlook this dimension of the skin because they are, at least in their dermatological works, almost exclusively interested in human beings. But move out in any direction from our perch in the order of nature, and you will quickly see, as Cruikshank already did, that the function of the skin clearly "shews an affinity" to that of the lungs, or indeed to that of the stomach: assimilation, making the outer inner. Jellyfish, for example, lack a specialized respiratory system, since their outer membrane is sufficiently thin to absorb oxygen by diffusion. Nor do they have a mouth, properly speaking, but only an oral surface that engulfs, passively in the course of their natural motion, the zooplankton and other small animals that are then absorbed into the jelly bell of their body. Even the autotrophic life forms-those that do not have to eat other life forms but can get by just fine on minerals and light-even these proud beings must absorb, must find a way to make the outer inner. And they do so, as if they had any other choice, through their surfaces.</p>

<p> But the skin is not just a sieve or a cheesecloth with no integrity. It is also, as Cruikshank says, quasi vinculum totius corporis, like a chain that makes the whole body one. "The Romans called it pellis," he reflects, "evidently from pellens, repelling; as it forms vesications, and endeavours to push off matter, suddenly offending the body, as on application of scalding water, liquid caustic, alkali, or red hot iron."9 (It is not clear to what experiments the English scientist is referring here.) </p>

<p>Cruikshank identifies the three layers of human skin recognized today, but gives them slightly different names than our own: there is the outermost "scarf skin" or cuticle (that is, the epidermis), underneath which we find the rete mucosum or mucous net (the dermis). Beneath these two strata is "the surface of the skin itself," that is, the "true skin" (the subcutaneous
tissue or hypodermis). The dermis is today generally divided into two layers, the lower of which is the "reticular region," that is, the layer of the integumentary organ that resembles most closely a sort of net. Nets are peculiar things: they hold much in, but let much out. In his Garden of Cyrus: Or, The Quincuncial-Lozenge of 1658—the same year Gassendi was busy logically deducing pores from sweat—the esoteric Baconian author Thomas Browne identifies the reticulum, alongside the quincunx, as one of the basic forms in art and nature. In the Temple of Solomon, Browne tells us, we find "fenestrae reticulatae"; in the "Cod of the Sachel-Palm" (the trunk of the palm tree), there is "neat Reticulate Work"; "Reticulate Grain" is observable in
"some Russia Leather": and there is a "natural Net" in "the Scaly Covering of Fishes." And, finally, "the same is also observable in some Part of the Skin of Man, in Habits of neat Texture, and therefore not unaptly compared unto a Net." This "Reticulate or Net-work" is found not only outside but inside as well, "not only from the first Subtegmen or Warp of his Formation, but
in the Netty Fibres of the Veins and Vessels of Life." Thus does anatomy emphatically extend "that Elegant Expression of Scripture, 'Thou hast curiously embroidered me, thou hast wrought me up after the finest Way of Texture, and as it were with a Needle.'"10</p>


<p> The mucous net of the human body is a sort of divine embroidery, or, to return to the image of the vinculum, it is a sort of chain mail. In either case, it is what makes the body one and whole, holding in—again, if only barely—what would otherwise spill out. In 1924, the great Lee Morse sang: "Tain't no sin / to take off your skin / and dance around in your bones." But of course it is a sin, or it would be if it were possible. Skin is the first clothes, the kind you cannot take off but that, like the non-obligate vestments placed on top of it, make the man. </p>


<p> Derrida, focused upon the skin as sensorium, overlooked the ways in which skin manifests itself as reticulation and porosity, and took it instead for some sort of taut bladder, like a water balloon distended by its fluid contents. There are yet other features of skin that escape attention when we attend exclusively to the sense of touch. For one thing, it is regenerative,
like the amputated claws of lobsters or the arms of the axolotl, even if we are less impressed with our own mundane power of cicatrization, responsible for the unsightly-though neither horrific nor, it seems to us, miraculous-scabs on a child's knees. </p>

<p>And there is, finally, the strange and perpetual tendency of skin to be shed, cast off, sloughed, which brings us somewhat back to our thought experiment, and to the essential flux or fountainousness of human corporeality with which we began. As Cruikshank noted, there are two different ways to discard the cuticle in animals, "either sensibly at one period of the year, or insensibly in scales, at all times of the year, as in man." Certain scaly creatures, and all those with shells or exoskeletons, do it all at once, while those with feathers, fur, or, like us, with little else but skin, do it gradually and constantly. Aristotle describes all forms of molting and shedding as, in their essence, a sort of rejuvenation, a "cast[ing] off" of "the so-called 'old-age."12 For him, the shedding of skin, fur, or exoskeleton is a biological process on a par with emerging from hibernation, where the burrow or den is comparable to a bodily shell. Those creatures that molt all at once leave a husk behind, a sort of hollow, shadow likeness of themselves with all the former life of it departed from within. Those that shed little by little barely notice they are doing it. Cruikshank describes an experiment by Herman Boerhaave, who "thought he proved [the] existence" of the cast-off skin "by wearing continually black silk gloves, which after some time he inverted, and thought he clearly saw these scales."13 As with perspiration, it is hard to believe, and hard to witness it happening directly, but the effluvia we give off can leave no doubt: our bodies are not armor-plated tanks nor even swishing balloons, as there is no real boundary, whatever our folk metaphysics tells us, between our inner parts and the outer world. That non-boundary, namely, is the skin.</p>
